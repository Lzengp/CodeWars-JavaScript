## 题目
Typically, reversing an array is a pretty straightforward task even for novice programmers. But not when a crowd of angry zombies scratching your door, looking for a fresh brains. In this case even skilled ninja-geek probably prefer to quickly push his code on github to have enough time to find a chainsaw. So there's two obstacles:

1、Your code needs to be as short as possible, in fact not longer than 28 characters

2、Because you are scared and stressed you have forgotten how to use the standard reverse() method

#Input: an array containing data of any types. Ex: [1,2,3,'a','b','c',[]] #Output: [[],'c','b','a',3,2,1]

## 题目解析
题目内容很简单，就是反转数组，但是字数限制在28字符之内，并且不能使用reverse

## 思路
开始想到的思路就是创建一个空数组，然后循环原数组，然后把原数组的值给空数组, 但是这样就超了
```js
weirdReverse=a=>{
  const arr=new Array(a.length);
  a.map((e,i)=>{arr[a.length-i-1]=e});
  return arr;
}
```

## 评价最高代码
```js
weirdReverse=a=>a.sort(_=>1) 
```
