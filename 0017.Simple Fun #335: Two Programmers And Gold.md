## [17.Simple Fun #335: Two Programmers And Gold](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59549d482a68fe3bc2000146/javascript)
### 难度：5 kyu

## 题目
In the field, two programmers A and B found some gold at the same time. They all wanted the gold, and they decided to use the following rules to distribute gold:

They divided gold into n piles and be in line. The amount of each pile and the order of piles all are randomly.

They took turns to take away a pile of gold from the far left or the far right.

In each round, the programmer will use his wisdom to choose the gold that is best for him.

Input
An integer array representing gold. 
Output
Calculated final amount of gold obtained by A and B in a two-element array [amount of A, amount of B].
Note, we can assume that A always takes first, and each time they used the best strategy.

Example
For golds = [10,1000,2,1], the output should be [1001,12].

At 1st turn, A can take 10 or 1, 10 is greater than 1.
Should we choose 10? No, clever programmer don't think so ;-)
Because if A choose 10, next turn B can choose 1000.
So, A choose 1 is the best choice.

At 2nd turn, Whether B chooses 10 or 2, in the 3rd turn, A can always choose 1000. 
So, B choose 10 is the best choice.

Final result:
A: 1 + 1000 = 1001
B: 10 + 2 = 12
For golds = [10,1000,2], the output should be [12,1000].

In this example, the choice A faces is the same as the 2nd turn in the previous example.

## 题目解析
给定一个数组，计算分成两个数组的最优解。比如给定[10,1000,2,1]，数组A应该是[1, 1000]， 数组B应该是[10, 2]吗，最终返回的结果是数组A和B和的集合[1001, 12];
给定[10,1000,2]数组，那么A应该分得[10, 2]，数组B分得[1000]，最终输出的结果是[12,1000]

## 解题思路
其实想到的就是求最优解，然后动态规划，递归这些，但是还是想不出方法解决。

```js
function distributionOf(arr){
  var sum=arr.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0),l=0,r=arr.length-1,rec={},
      r1=calc(sum,l,r),r2=sum-r1
  return [r1,r2]
  
  function calc(sum,l,r){
    if(l==r) return arr[l]
    var s=l+","+r
    if(rec[s]!==undefined) return rec[s]
    var r1=calc(sum-arr[l],l+1,r),r2=calc(sum-arr[r],l,r-1),
        rs=sum-Math.min(r1,r2)
    rec[s]=rs
    return rs
  }
}
```
