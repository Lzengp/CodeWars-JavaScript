## [8.Multiplying numbers as strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55911ef14065454c75000062/javascript)
### 4kyu

## 题目
This is the first part. You can solve the second part here when you are done with this. Multiply two numbers! Simple!
```
1.The arguments are passed as strings.
2.The numbers may be way very large
3.Answer should be returned as a string
4.The returned "number" should not start with zeros e.g. 0123 is invalid
```

Note: 100 randomly generated tests!

## 题目大意
其实就是大数相乘，之前也有一题是计算大数的

## 代码
这里使用现有的函数BigInt
```js
function multiply(a, b) {
  return (BigInt(a) * BigInt(b)).toString();
}
```
