## [1.NIM the game](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54120de842dff35232000195/javascript)
### 难度：4 kyu

## 题目
This kata explores writing an AI for a two player, turn based game called NIM.

### The Board

The board starts out with several piles of straw. Each pile has a random number of straws.

```js
Pile 0: ||||

Pile 1: ||

Pile 2: |||||

Pile 3: |

Pile 4: ||||||

...or more concisely: [4,2,5,1,6]
```

### The Rules

* The players take turns picking a pile, and removing any number of straws from the pile they pick
* A player must pick at least one straw
* If a player picks the last straw, she wins!

### The Task

In this kata, you have to write an AI to play the straw picking game.

You have to encode an AI in a function choose_move (or chooseMove, or choose-move) that takes a board, represented as a list of positive integers, and returns

```js
[pile_index, number_of_straws]
```
Which refers to an index of a pile on the board, and some none-zero number of straws to draw from that pile.

The test suite is written so that your AI is expected to play 50 games and win every game it plays.

## 优解
```js
function chooseMove(state) {
  let x = state.reduce((acc, s) => acc^s, 0);
  for (let [i, e] of state.entries()) {
    if ((e ^ x) < e) {
     return [i, e - (e ^ x)];
    }
  }
}
```

## 优解分析
**^**  是异或运算，例如 **1^3 = 2**

1二进制是0001
3二进制是0011
异或是相同是0，不同是1，所以0001和0011做异或运算之后是0010，也就是十进制的2
